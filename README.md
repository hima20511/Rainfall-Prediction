Machine learning with python: 
Machine Learning is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics. 
Machine Learning is a step into the direction of Machine learning is a program that analyzes data and learns to 
predict the outcome.  
Machine learning models used are: 
1. Random Forest 
2. Na√Øve Bayes 
3. Decision Trees 
4. Support Vector Machine 
5. K Nearest Neighbours
Dataset Features: Date,Place,Temperature,pressure,humidity,rain,rain tomorrow etc.
Outcome: Predicts whether it will rain tomorrow or not
